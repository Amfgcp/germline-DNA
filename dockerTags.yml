# This file contains the docker tags used in the pipeline.
# The containers used by default are biocontainers uploaded on quay.io.
# https://quay.io/organization/biocontainers
# Tags are supplied by giving the name of the tool ('bwa' for example) and the
# desired tag on biocontainers ('0.7.17--h84994c4_5' for example). So
# `"bwa": "0.7.17--h84994c4_5"` evaluates to
# "quay.io/biocontainers/bwa:0.7.17--h84994c4_5" as the container used in the
# pipeline.
# If the container for the tool used is not from quay.io/biocontainers this is
# noted in a comment.
# Tools are sorted alphabetically for ease of use.
